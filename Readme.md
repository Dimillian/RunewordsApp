# Runewords App

This small SwiftUI app have two purposes:

* Making a clean, fully SwiftUI app using all the latest iOS 16 / Xcode 14 features.
* Browse, search, filter Diablo II Runes and Runeswords.

While playing Diablo II I often need to do a lot of searching around the internet to see which runewords I can craft with my current runes. This app make it very simple to filter, search runewords by name, item base or runes.

The Stash feature is still under the making.

This project have no external dependencies and make no network calls.

You'll need Xcode 14 latest beta to comple it.
